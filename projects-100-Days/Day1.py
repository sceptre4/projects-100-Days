I am signing on for Replit's 100 days of Python Challenge!
I will make sure to spend some time every day coding along, for a minumum of 10 minutes a day.
I'll be using Replit, an amazing onlin IDE so I can do this from phone whenever I happen to be.  No excuses for not coding from the middle of a field
I am feeling :)
