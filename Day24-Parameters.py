    This subroutine creates a random pin number for us. This subroutine (called `pinPicker`) has the parameter called `number` (how many numbers I want to have in this pin). Then, there is a string (called `pin`) that is empty and a `for` loop that is used to create a defined amount of random numbers. The variable `number` controls how many times the loop will add the new number to the pin. This is done through `+=` and concatenating new values. We will cast the random number as a string so it can be concatenated together. 

Then...the magic...we `return` the pin.

ðŸ‘‰ Let's see what happens:

```python
#subroutine has parameter called `number`
#`number` shows how many numbers we want the pin to have
def pinPicker(number):
  import random
  pin = "" #this is the empty string
  for i in range(number): #for loop shows defined amount of random numbers
    pin += str(random.randint(0,9)) #we want a string of random numbers between 0-9
  return pin
    
pinPicker(4) #4 means we want 4 random numbers
```

## Nothing happens? Why?

The line `pinPicker(4)` that calls for a 4 digit pin is being replaced by a 4 digit pin. (That's great, but I don't see that happening...)

We are not telling the computer to do anything with the string that was created. How do we make the string appear?

With `print` of course!

ðŸ‘‰ Let's assign a variable to `pinPicker`:

```python
myPin = pinPicker(4)
